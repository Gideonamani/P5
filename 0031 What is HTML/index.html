		<em><b>You've probably already figured this out, but here's a brief distinction between your HTML file and the DOM.  After you've typed out your HTML file it stays the same unless of course you go back to it and either manually delete something or add more code.  Your DOM (the tree structure you drew) relates to the HTML file and its structure, as you showed, but it can change.  For instance if you use JavaScript so that when you click on your H1 title in the browser it disappears.  Now your DOM tree structure will no longer have an H1 tag, but your HTML file still does.  Your DOM is basically the rendering of your HTML file and its structure, but will change as you interact with the rendered page in your browser.  Most of the time it's your JavaScript code that will change it.  So sometimes your DOM structure is the same as your HTML file structure, other times it will look very different.  It's based on your HTML, but can and will change with user interaction.ï»¿
